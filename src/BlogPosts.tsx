I used Tuple to partner with my mentor Alex where we discussed the process of estimating jobs and features. After deploying this blog site, I will proceed to setup the environment on the Mac Mini that he has provided me as well as watch the first video if time permits! The Mac Mini is set up with the proper environment for the clojure koans and the first few koans are complete.",
