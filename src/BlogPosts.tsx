    blog: "This is my first blog post. Today I learned about a lot of tools that I will use to be successful at Clean Coders. Tuple, CC-Epic, and CC-Poker. I used Tuple to partner with my mentor Alex where we discussed the process of estimating jobs and features. After deploying this blog site, I will proceed to setup the environment on the Mac Mini that he has provided me as well as watch the first video if time permits! The Mac Mini is set up with the proper environment for the clojure koans and the first few koans are complete.",

    blog: "Koans! Today I did Koans 7 - 20. Going back through the Koans a second time has been a great refresher. I got stuck on a couple of the problems but proceeded to use the lein REPL to evaluate expressions and figure out my answers. Taking deeper dives into some of the key functions I learned the power of 'Let' to bind data structures to symbols. This is great way to destructure a datatype. 'Ref' will help us create a mutable object which I imagine could be great for managing things like state. ",

    blog: "There is no shortage of information to be learned! After pushing through a couple of more Koans, I met with Alex J and understand some of the Koans I had earlier got to pass but didn't fully understand why. I now understand meta data a bit better, The ability to attach underlying data to an object. I found myself going into docs today to read more about some Clojure functions (seq vs sequence, meta, vary-meta, and more).<br> Alex Root popped in to say welcome, which was very appreciated and made me feel like a part of the team even more! Macros are confusing. After spending some time trying to understand where I was going wrong I again asked for some help and got clarification on the 'recursive-infix' problem within macros. After restructuring the macro being create I was lead to find a further use for the 'drop' function as well as nthrest(the ability to take the end of a form starting at a certain index). <br> Koans are complete although I will be scouring back through them in due time. Multimethods are very useful, similar to 'method overloading' in c#; This gives us the ability to have different outputs from the same function based on the inputing parameters.",
