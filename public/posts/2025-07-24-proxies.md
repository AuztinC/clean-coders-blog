How do we authenticate a user? What about making our website fast even though it will be loading in some high resolution images? This and many more applications are call for a proxy. An intermediary that is helpful for capturing information about a request or deciding weather the request should even be granted!

As mentioned previously, a proxy can be used for multiple purposes, some of the general examples would be a virtual proxy that is good for lazy loading images, a remove proxy that can help a remote system appear local, or a logging proxy that is helpful to capture history or counts of the request.
