After working through the tests to completely parse the initial request line, the ideas of parsing the headers became much simpler to grasp. Reading in each line with a while loop until we run out of lines to read. Looking at each line, I am able to handle returning the headers as a key=value pair. This comes with some errors to throw for having a content-length with no body, or a mismatch value in bytes. Using a char[] to read in bytes and determine how long the body will be. With this setup, I should be able to properly parse a request and send it off to be handled seperately. Using this to make some sort of response message should be the next step and hopefully will manage to come together easily.
