Yet again lunch and learn comes along to make me acknowledge another week has come to an end. Looking through the presentation that I had put together, I was disappointed with my work. It was very wordy and felt like a death by powerpoint. Hoping to add to the experience with some added visuals, I added new backgrounds to some of the slides. Althought the content didn't change too much, small formatting adjustments.

The presentation came and went in a flash. It was a lot of content to spew in just a few minutes. The lack of feedback tells me all I had expected, it was boring. Hopefully next week I can come up with something better on whatever topic my mentor decides.

After some needed break time playing and chatting with the others I turned my focus on the database story for the week. Changing the format turned out to be more of challenge than expected, but helped me gain some extra experience with parsing data and reformatting when needed. I even got to use a new clojure function 'walk/keywordize-keys'. This is great when parsing data from json and wanting to get your stringified keys back to keywords!

Looking a bit into quil, I am still quite intimidated. Hopeflly some things start to click over the weekend for me. This will be a great finishing touch on my tic-tac-toe and I look forward to seeing the completed project.

Another great week, so happy to be in this position. Thankful for the team I have.
