What a phrase, the 'Zone of Pain'. But that's the life of a concrete component that carries many dependents. Such a place comes with many responsibilities, whereas the life of an abstract class or interface who no one depends upon. This opposition creates the ‘Zone of Uselessness’, which is not quite as fun to think about but equally important to understand. Today’s video information was packed full of new topics throughout the two major categories of Component Cohesion and Component Design.

'Avoid creating classes that depend on methods that they don't use. Avoid making components that depend on classes they don't use.' These two principles are eerily similar, are they not? The first pertaining to the Interface Segregation Principle and the second refering to the Common Reuse Principle. Both painting the same big picture in that you should not build a system with unused assets lying around wasting space.

'When someone changes something you depend upon. Make sure it hurts them more than it hurts you!' A beautifly spoken description of the Stable Dependency Principle by Uncle Bob. There was so much to take in today that I will certainly be revisiting my notes on these videos.

After going through some previous eulers again as refreshers this morning I popped open OBS and recorded another fizzbuzz session. Test-Driven Development is a process that feels like is has swells of momentum. Using this idea when searching for the right song I happen to come accross a Beethoven symphony that I feel fit the rising and falling of the process. This was a fun project to set up and is now something I can watch myself and learn from.

This was a fantastic week of being an apprentice. I knocked out so much that I really surprised myself. I'm feeling proud of the amount of work I accomplished, but I will not let that get over confident. There is so much ahead!
