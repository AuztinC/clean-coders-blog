Sometimes the things we think we don't need, we actually might. Previously when refactoring the database implementations and thinking that I could solve the problem without keeping track of the actual current game in some fashion, I made a decision to delete my 'clear-active' sort of function. Eventually after deciding to add back an active game using the state map, I found myself needing a function that performed the same essential logic but in a different data set.

Getting this setup helped me solidify what my databse solutions needed. Thankfully, only a couple of tests needed to be refactored in order to force this change, and they all seemed to come together nicely. The functionality is back!
