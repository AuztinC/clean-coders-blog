Being the curator our daily meetings is really fun. Sharing some things that I enjoy to learn about with the team has helped my apprenticeship even, I believe. Becoming more comfortable within the team is essential!

The idea of having an AI based kata is really interesting. When it was mentioned my mind started reeling, how could that work? What project would be simple enough to get consistent answers from the prompts but challenging enough for a clean coders kata? I'm excited to see what everyone comes up with and try them myself.
