Koans! Today I did Koans 7 - 20. Going back through the Koans a second time has been a great refresher. I got stuck on a couple of the problems but proceeded to use the lein REPL to evaluate expressions and figure out my answers. Taking deeper dives into some of the key functions I learned the power of 'Let' to bind data structures to symbols. This is great way to destructure a datatype. 'Ref' will help us create a mutable object which I imagine could be great for managing things like state.
