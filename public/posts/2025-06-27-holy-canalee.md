Being un-able to present my Decorator Design Pattern today was a little bit of a disappointment. Losing a crown on a tooth is scary, so I had to get an appointment set up asap this morning which left me away from my desk during lunch and learn. This was handled promptly and allowed me to make it back with a little time to spare of the day.

Working through the new tests for the re-design of my postgres tables has been a really fun and enlightening process. I am thankful for getting to spend time talking about how these tables should look and how to create the relationship between a game and the moves for a given game. While I had previous postgres experience, it has admittedly been a long time since I have had to implement any relationships between tables.

Switching my tests from using a 'test' database to stubbing out all of the db functions was another good lesson. Not only to see the multiple ways that tests like this can be written, but to get to hear how Micah and Alex think about these things was benificial as well. At this point I have don't most of my new tests for postgres with only a couple left to do.

After last week, I am grateful for a week of refactoring. The pressure of the full GUI and a database refactor was a lot. This time I have only a couple of things left in my GUI logic and this refactor is shaping up nicely.

I'm very happy to be on this team and can't wait to find out what my next project will be based on.
