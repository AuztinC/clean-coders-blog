Refactoring is NOT always easy. After spending the morning adding music to my kata video and getting the video put onto youtube, it was time for lunch and learn already! Realizing way too late that this time was approaching, I left myself with no time to practice or really give a good look at my presentation today. Listening to the feedback I can totally agree with everyone about my animations. I went overboard on them.

Getting a weekly break for an hour or two with the team is a really nice time to get away from the pressure of the stories. Once we all parted from the activities, I dove into my refactoring story about how my previous games are being stored. Going into the problem I thought that it really wouldn't be that much work. At this point I have refactored all of the functions that were involved in this process and decided to add a competely new system. One that will handle initializing a game into the previous-games key and a seperate system that will find a game and update its :moves key. This has come with the addition of multi-methods for my previous methods that were handling seperate storage devices based on a case. Every step of the way has come with new test and refactoring old ones as well. The whole process has taken me much longer than I expected. I will be working on the weekend to complete this and definitely get a refresher on postgres.

Grateful to be in this position at Clean Coders.
