Failing at anything never feels good. The fact that I failed at the same two things for two weeks in a row has been a huge setback for me both in my apprenticeship's progress and my confidence. This database refactoring has been a much larger project than I had anticipated. Having to change all of data storage implementations set me way back. Attempting to handle this all on my own caused me to make critical errors in the design of my code. I am at a point now that I have to admit that I did not follow the principles that I had been learning. There should not have been as much of a headache from the changes that have been recently made. Having my gui fail in different places than my cli has pointed out some inconsistencies and violations. Spending a whole day this week handling a games replay and continuing into a game only to have those features fail for this update was devistating.

At this point, having such bad ties in my project, I almost want to take a step back and rething my understanding of the principles and how to properly design a system. I almost have to ask myself, have I been practicing what I have been preaching during these presentations?

Getting a compliment on the presentation today was a good feeling though. Finally I have a week that I do not have to worry about a presentation which always causes me to lose a whole day.

This is going to be a good week. I will not let this setback bring me down. I will continue to learn and grow. There is no way that I will let this opportunity slip away because I have worked so hard for it.

A huge huge thank you to my Mentor this last and coming weeks. There has been a huge amount of patience involved with helping me re-write this code. So thank you Alex!
