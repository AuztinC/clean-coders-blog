What a finish strong with Tic-Tac-Toe. Using the last bit of time today, I decided to finalize some test and remove prints that were left hanging out. While doing some of the finishing touches, I added things like which AI's difficulty are you choosing in the GUI to be consistent with the CLI UI. These were some of the smaller things that help the game really feel interactive.

While in the meeting I couldn't help but wonder what could possibly be the next step in the games evolution. The awnser to my next task was a much more complicated one than an upgrade to the little game that I had been buiding all of this time. I am now to build a complete HTTP server in Java and it has to have a rather large amount of features to start with. Given only 1 week to complete this mammoth of a task, I was sent out in the world to see what I can do. The whole idea of this was extremely intimidating. Having a fairly limited time using already build frameworks to build a server and api for responses, I might have left the meeting with a rather sweaty set of palms.

I am still very excited to be doing this project. It will have a slew of great lessons for me that I really need to fully absorb. This is an important step in my development career and I must master this, or as close as possible.
