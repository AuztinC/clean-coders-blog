The proxy presentation went well. I believe I conveyed the idea of all of the types of proxies well and some simple code examples to go along with that.

Spending all day yesterday on the presentation really put me in a tough spot with the http tic tac toe abstraction. Getting the project up and running was my main priority to start, learning how to control external libraries with the deps.edn file makes me feel in control of my project. Although, after changing my Java project to a clojure project on accident by adding a deps.edn file there was a funny mistake. Thankfully I asked for assistance at the right time and was able to correct that right in the beginning. Once the Java project and TTT were both added as libs I could get into the meat of it. Starting my first functions by attempting to re-create the server startup that is in my main.java file.

This was a big day of bridging the gap between what Java inheritence means in Clojure. Using deftypes to copy a Java interface is great for maintaining consistency with subclasses, even accross projects. Using the '.' to instatiate new instances of classes makes calling methods inside of them a breeze too.

Super thankful for the assistance today, both Scoops and Alex really helped a ton! Book club was also really fun and I am glad that we made time for it.
