Coming out of IPM I was fairly crushed after spending so long iterating on ideas to force the concepts to sink in. The project was a lot of work in itself, and the when the ideas are new as well as the language it is a big challenge to produce anything of quality. After the meeting I had to take a walk and when I came back I put my head down and got to work. Writing tests that lead me to fixing my previous root problem. The GET /form route with query params came next. This was fairly simple to solve by splitting the request path into a map with key=value pairs.
