Refactoring is all of the time, never ignore it. Never put it on a schedule. I need to recite this more often to myself as I am building out a solution. Follow the three laws of test-driven development, one: 'You're not allowed to write any production code until  you have a failing test.', two: 'Stop writing the test as soon as it fials, even if its a compiler error.', and finally 'Stop writing the production code as soon as the test passes.' These are essential to building out a solution incrementally without getting stuck in the mud. Play code golf and try to make a test pass with as few keystrokes as possible, have fun with the process.

Getting to refactor with Alex has been eye-opening, yet again. As I am growing with clojure I am sure that these solutions will come to me easier, but as of now they are hard to see. When creating programs I need to search for more solutions that my typical javascript-way of doing things. Clojure can be clean and way more readable and I need to take advantage of that.

Grateful to have gotten the help again today and thankful for my Mentor Alex!
