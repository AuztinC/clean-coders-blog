Exciting new challenges are heading my way! Digging deeper into tic-tac-toe has been a really fun and new way to look at clojure. I'm getting a lot of ideas on how to handle the state and am looking foward to having a finished project. The presentations today were really exciting! I feel like a received way better feedback than my first one, thats a great thing. Then getting to watch Nathan perform a rather exceptional kata was energizing. It made me want to get more confident in presenting things like that, I find myself rushing through the process where-as he really took his time. Following his performance, it was nice to see Nick's artistic passion really show today. I learned a bit about some art concepts that I hadn't heard be defined, but was such very nicely.

Getting to have my mentor walk through his thought process about certain problems and ideas was also a great refresher of new ways to tackle problems. Getting to refactor eulers is really cool because it feels like my code just feels better after. I look forward to seeing my code start in these states! It was a great Friday and I plan on making progress on t-t-t a bit over the weekend if possible.
