Function names matter, and should be no longer than around 4 lines. Something I have felt myself wondering in the past, have my function names been descriptive enough? Probably not, when I reflect back and think about some of the projects where I was in a hurry to get my idea out and didn't want to be slowed down by writing out long names that would have helped anyone ready my code if ever they chose to. Even I myself would have benefited from this simply by knowing that I could go back and immediately understand what I was trying to accomplish within a function.

Uncle Bob doesn't much care for comments. The idea is a sound one, your code should speak for itself and when someone reads it, there should not be a confusion based on function and variable names, and the flow of logic. Using white-space properly is something I have tried to keep consistent throughout my projects. Using only 1 space is Bob's convention, which I think is a reasonable one.

Avoiding temporal coupling by passing a block. Tell, don't ask, as to avoid long chain calls from functions that should be seperated out. Keeping a file at around 60 lines of code and at most 100 to 120 to ensure clear intent and workflow. These and so many other concepts today really gave me a lot to think about when I'm writing my next lines of code.

All of this learning, and getting to watch Uncle Bob do clean-up on these projects and complete the stack kata was a great bonus for todays lessons.
