Coming out of my fifth Iterative meeting I am feeling more confident in my ability to complete tasks. I am working on my presentation for the Liskov Substitution Principle and am sort of struggling to come up with ideas that fully make sense for code examples. I want my presentations to have some sort of new way to visualize the problem at least and not just the same old examples that I'm sure all of the craftsman have seen from every new apprenctice.

Getting to improve my tic-tac-toe is an exciting story for the week, I look forward to having a fully working game with playable options. I will need to work on my kata a lot tomorrow because I got so caught up in the presentation that I did not jump into that yet. Building minimax again in clojure was a challenge in itself, but now building upon that idea will be easier since I now have a much better grasp of using recursion in the language.

Tomorrow I will work hard to complete this and at least two other tasks for my week.
