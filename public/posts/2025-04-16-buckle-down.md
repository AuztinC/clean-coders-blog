Performing the fizzbuzz today during my first real IPM check in was a fun and helpful experience overall. I am happy to be receiving such great feedback from developers as talented as the ones here at Clean Coders. Running through the problem at such a fast pace during my practice unfortunately turned out to be a mistake. This habit carried into the performance that I did today and I can understand my appearing to be rushing. My takeaway from the experience is that I need to slow down sometimes. Even if I know what the next step is, maybe there is an alternative to solving the problem in a quicker or more convenient way that I just hadn’t considered in the moment.

Doing my estimates made me a little bit nervous my ability to properly estimate. This is the time to learn what I am capable of, though. Once the process of estimating my stories for the week was over, I jumped right into a presentation on the Single Responsibility Principle.

Finishing the day I completed two more Euler’s, putting me at the 7th. I am proud of that progress as I went into both problems unsure how to get the answers. Now, to keep the momentum throughout this week and make sure I’m taking the time to adjust the small things that the feedback has made me aware of in my code.
