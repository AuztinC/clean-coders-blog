What is a component? How do you formulate the structure of a component? What are the principles we should follow when creating components? Going back through all of this information was a great refresher on how to compose components with some rules to follow. Using the Single Responsibility principle to decompose your system into actors is the start of designing your components. We group these by what actor they serve as well as following the six principles.

The component cohesion principles tell us how to compose a component out of classes. This is made up of three principles, the Release Reuse Equivalence Principle, the Common Closure Principle, and the Common Reuse Principle.

The component coupling principles help us determine which components should depend on each other. Consisting of three more principles, the Acyclic Dependencies Principle, the Stable Depenedencies Principle, and the Stable Abstractions Principle.

All of this followed by the formulas and how to calculate stability makes for a rather long presentation that I feel is wordy. There is a lot of information in the principles, though, and it was a challenge to fit.
