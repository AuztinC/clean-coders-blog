The power of repetition is so powerful that will shape habits and influence behavior. A daily reminder to think a certain way. This thought keeps me scouring my notes daily from previous videos, and looking over my euler problems to get back into the headspace of the problems. Rewatching the Interface Segregation video today was great and helped solidify the principle. Being forced to carry extra baggage is never a fun experience, why would we let our code have that experience? Avoiding this will help prevent the inevitable violation of the Liskov Substitution principle as well, and then we begin the dominos.

Researching the information for my presentations has lead me to think more about the use of multi-method functions, protocols, and records. Protocols are going to be a great way to carry a method with variable parameters but the same behavior. Using something like this, the bowling game could look much different. There could be a bunch of protocols that carry the different logical behaviors of the game and a record that implements all of them with their given parameters. This kind of code is really intriguing to me and I look forward to trying something like it!
