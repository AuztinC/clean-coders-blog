Using Quil again has been a lot of fun. I am getting a better understanding of how to create menus and change between them. So far, most of menus are created and there is some possible transition between them. Currently I am using a large conditional statement to handle the transition between screens based on a :screen keyword in my state object. My mentor quickly pointed out my lack of tests and that is something I worked a little on yesterday afternoon and will try to add more of today. When starting the project I made a spec files for tests but then quickly went into how to handle the transitions and jumped into making the visuals of the menus.

Creating some hlper functions along the way like draw-buttons and in-button? to check for clicking inside of the buttons has helped to simplify the reading of functinos.

Now I need to implement my working logic into this gui and make the game play as well. This will be a big challenge tomorrow I believe. Can't wait to see it completed!
