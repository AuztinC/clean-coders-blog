The ability to replay a game that has completed has finally started to show itself. Today was a tough day of writing what seemed like endless test to try and get some momentum started. Writing tests that were supposed to be leading my toward victory wound up having me chasing my tail in circles. Granted this is absolutely at my own expense. I should not have used as much time attempting to write a worthy test. Getting caught up with fixing my state object earlier today really made the deadline of my story a little more nerve wracking. Eventually after dealing with a lot of thinking about my next move, I was able to make some progress on the replay ability once I have parsed out the previous game that I will be looking for. Using a stub on the edn/state to include my :id 1 game ensured that I can grab a specific game. The replay function lets me toss the board size and moves list in and watch the magic happen!

I'm looking forward to completing this implementation tomorrow.
