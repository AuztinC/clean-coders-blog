Testing a problem out is becoming a go to habit when looking at a problem now and that's great. When it comes to implementing these tests I am definitely in need of practice. The building of tests with multiple layers of set up functions is still a big concept for my tiny testing brain. But as Uncle Bob tells us, start small with a degenerate test and a problem to solve, incrementaly work you way towards the goal one green test at a time.

Arrange, Act, Assert! Well, that was the way. Then along comes another A! Annihilate, or to destroy the left over effects of a test. I'm happy to learning more about the ideas of creating useful and modular testing and look forward to being a master at utilizing them. Using transient fresh fixtures whenever possible, and keeping teardowns to a minimum.
