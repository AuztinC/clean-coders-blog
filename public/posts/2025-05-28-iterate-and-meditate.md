After meeting with my clients for my iterative meeting, I left slightly deflated. Dropping the ball on testing some of the core functionality of my reading/writing to edn was a wake up that I need to make a couple of changes. Using my production project for testing things like reading and writing was a mistake. It made me fail to write the tests that should have lead me to properly implementing this feature.

Thankfully, I have a great mentor who has been extremely patient and helpful about these things. Getting to pair after the meeting and work through how some of the tests should have been written was very helpful and insightful. Being able to trust a core function is a must, so why not be able to stub its functionality out? I was overthinking this process when trying to write tests that fit my already working code, when it should have been the other way around anyways. Not only was he a major help for understanding how to properly stub those functions but also with some of the ideas of state flow and usage of parameterizing the storage service used.

Getting into Java only slightly was a really fun change for the end of the day today. I was able to get a project running with my own class running a 'Hello World'. Tomorrow I will look into how to properly set up tests so I can begin practicing my bowling kata in a new language! Very grateful for another meeting with my clients that ended in a positive.
