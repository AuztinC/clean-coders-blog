There is no shortage of information to be learned! After pushing through a couple of more Koans, I met with Alex J and understand some of the Koans I had earlier got to pass but didn't fully understand why. I now understand meta data a bit better, The ability to attach underlying data to an object. I found myself going into docs today to read more about some Clojure functions (seq vs sequence, meta, vary-meta, and more).

Alex Root popped in to say welcome, which was very appreciated and made me feel like a part of the team even more! Macros are confusing. After spending some time trying to understand where I was going wrong I again asked for some help and got clarification on the 'recursive-infix' problem within macros. After restructuring the macro being create I was lead to find a further use for the 'drop' function as well as nthrest(the ability to take the end of a form starting at a certain index).

Koans are complete although I will be scouring back through them in due time. Multimethods are very useful, similar to 'method overloading' in c#; This gives us the ability to have different outputs from the same function based on the inputing parameters.
