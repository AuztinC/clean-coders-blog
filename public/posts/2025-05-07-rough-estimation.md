The Test-driven development mindset is a discipline. At the start of my journey, the idea of using TDD was really an easy sell. The eulers are fantastic small problems to get the idea of TDD flowing. However, when I stepped up the project to a larger scale and also it being a project that I knew what direction I wanted to go, I ignored the process. Not purposefuly but blind haste I hurried through getting my ideas out.

Watching the Mocking videos was a great way to understand the different ways to test projects more thoroughly. Also getting to have help with this process in tic-tac-toe has been helpful. Using a combination of with-in-str and with-out-str and then stubbing out a function.

Getting to get a glance into a GUI framework today was an exciting moment. I am thrilled to jump into Quil and work on the game of life kata. Using a canvas is a fun way to draw graphics with javascript and Quil looks to be very similar so there will be some familiarity. It looks like it might even be set up to be easier to get started.
