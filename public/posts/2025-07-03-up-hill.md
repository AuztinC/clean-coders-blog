Today started off strong with crushing some bugs. The first one being a new game overwritting the last game in storage if that game wasn't finished. This sounds like something that should happen, except game A's ID would pair with game B's moves but in a new entry. This caused two games to have the same ID and would cause an error when trying to load and re-play games by IDs. The solution came with a new key in my edn state to hold a :current-game-id. Adding this allowed me to pull that game directly and when making a new game have an extra check that this new ID isn't the same as the active game.

Now in the postgres implementation this and some of the other updates need to be added with updates to the tests as well. A simple reason that nothing was working when running the game came to light when I found that the size of the board was being stored as 'boardsize' and needed to be parsed to 'board-size' to conform to the business logic.

Getting used to being in the club house will certainly get me progressing through errors faster. I am grateful to have the team to help and enjoy getting to spend little bits of time getting to know them better while getting some work done.
