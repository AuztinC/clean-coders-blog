How can confirm that all of the data we are sending to eachother over the web will be able to be read properly? How do we know how to read the data, what are the requirements for reading and responding to it? HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP is the solution given to resolve these problems when they arise. The foundation of communication on the web. In my previous projects I have learned a minimal amount about the underlying requirements and reasons behind why the information in a request or response to and from servers was formatted in the way it is. Building the logic behind this and enforcing the protocol against this communication is something that I had wondered about in a mystical sort of way. Getting to dig in and peek behind the curtain is really exciting.

The first line of the request was on the menu today. After getting a hands on understanding of how the communication will look, I was off to write the rules. Given some starting tests, I was able to get an understanding of the route I need to be on currently. Eventually writing and passing tests for the entire first line of the request consisting of the method, directory, and version. I am hopeful that my tests so far will hold up to what is going to be needed but will also be anticipating adding new ones.

This whole project comes with a much deeper dive into Java than my previous bowling kata or even data structures story had me doing. While this adds an extra layer of complexity to my solving this problem, I am still very excited to be building something like this for myself.
