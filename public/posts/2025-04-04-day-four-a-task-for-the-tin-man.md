How would one go about grouping the frequency in which an element occurs within a given collection? ChatGPT thought this would be a great practice lesson for me to solve, so I dove right in. While trying to use my wits and ability to problem solve, I came up with a conclusion that I thought was genius!

'Using Reduce and Assoc I can see if each element exists within the accumulator and update that keys value with Inc. This process took my a while of looking through docs and trying different map functions like Update.' This is when Alex jumped in to kick off the Euler project, and after showing him my progress he was happy to lead me to a function in the docs called Frequencies!.. This function is amazing for this exact task!

The process of building the frequencies function is still an important one to understand, though, and so I am excited to be able to build functions like these from scratch.

Euler 1 began with me having to fully understand Modulo(the Quotient of the init value by the given Mod), which I had only used briefly in the past to check for odd or even numbers. After helping me understand this concept fully, Alex lead me through my first use of TDD. We wrote some practice tests that helped with the Modulo practice before we took a break for Lunch and Learn. After games with the team, I went back to finish this Euler alone as Alex had become busy. Solving this problem felt really great! I found Kristi in the clubhouse and got great help from her on how to submit my answers for Eulers and also getting the next problem started.

Towards the end of the day, Alex suggested that I might begin watching through the videos, and so I finished the first video as well as exam.

It was a fantastic first week working with the Clean Coders team! I have been made to feel like a part of the team right away and I am grateful for that.
