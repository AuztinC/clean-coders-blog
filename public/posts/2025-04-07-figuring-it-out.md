The ability to precisely and accurately manage data within maps and vectors is slowly becoming more clear. The problem of grouping-frequencies was stepped up by the sum of the fibonacci sequence, followed by the largest prime factor of what might be the biggest number I've ever seen. Starting, I got some base case tests and examples of loop vs having a function call itself in the stack from Alex.

Using some powerful wizardry called recursion with a loop to set our collection and add to it while using fancy tools like last and butlast to get our last two numbers in the collection. Once these two numbers are added the result can be compared with our incoming 'n' value to see if we have reached our max value where it is ultimately filtered for the even numbers and then reduced with +.

The largest prime factor; sweet and simple, right? I started this problem alone and was slightly nervous about that. Choosing to separate out my functions, I began with factors alone. Base case is the game, get something running. After getting a simple 2 to pass through and struggling to gain movement forward. Eventually I stumbled upon a winning result, using a range to our n value and filtering any (mod n incrementing-number) that equal zero?; we get our factors which we can then run through the prime? function to filter any prime numbers. Both of these functions had to be refactored by using Math/sqrt n on our respective ranges.

Ending the day; I completed episode 2 and 3 of the clean coders videos. Also completing two more ChatGPT practice problems, the group-by-fn, finishing filter-duplicates, and a quick flip-map. Big day, many more to come.
