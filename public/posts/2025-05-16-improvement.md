Getting better feels so good. Today I felt very comfortable when building the logic for the game of life and even added some tests that better help me take the proper steps to having a better test suite backing up the project. Presenting at the lunch and learn today felt good as well. Public speaking in front of the team is becoming more natural with each principle.

Tic-tac-toe now has a 4x4 board that will soon be usable by a player. At the moment I have tested my way to having the options and input handling set up and ready to dive into adding the ability for a user to choose. Minimax is working but is very slow right now. I will need to do more researching on how to improve the speed of the ai because taking upwards of 20 seconds or more is not going to fly for most players.

I cannot wait to make this a speedy and playable version of the game! Another fantastic day of being an apprentice with the Clean Coders team!
