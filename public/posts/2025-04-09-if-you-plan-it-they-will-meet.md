Today was my first iterative planning meeting or IPM. I am happy to have a better understanding of what my weekly duties will be at least at this current level of the apprenticeship. Having to estimate is very hard and can be intimidating while doing so in front of multiple people. A feeling I will have to overcome and get confident in answering. The first week I feel I ended fairly strong. I will be proud, but aware that harder tasks are coming.

My first task became retaking some of the exams for the videos. While not being directly given a strict goal, I should have not had to go back to fix anything. That task is nearly complete already having only one more exam to fix in the morning first thing. I am actually glad I had to go back though becuase it gave me another opportunity to absorb the information in the videos. Getting to refresh things like how to remove switch statements from your code using polymorphic dispatch and create less dependancy issues due to fan-out, a little bit about Functional and Structured programming and what they are used for, and many other great lessons.

Tomorrow I am excited to finish off the previous exams and get started on the TDD videos after I complete the FizzBuzz Kata for the first time. Having to 'Live Perform' the kata is an interested and sort of scary one for me. However, Micah is right in that I should be so confident by a week of completing the task multiple times daily that it should be no problem to talk it out and explain each step in detail.

Thrilled to be an apprentice, learning from some really smart and helpful people.
