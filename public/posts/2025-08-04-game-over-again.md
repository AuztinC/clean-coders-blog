Watching my little tic tac toe evolve into the monster project it feels like it has become, relatively speaking; has been an amazing journey. I have learned so much about designing clean clode through trial and failure. While the journey is not over I feel it can be good to reflect.

My repetitive functions have been sticking out, the need to refactor is there. I am noticing how hard it can be, though, to go back while you are already on a deadline to get the next feature out.

Getting through the game-over screen today was great. I am getting to take more time to explore testing with hiccup and wire. The ability to test all functionality of an html element is super fun. CSS is even included, although I found for me, it is only if you use inline style with your hiccup elements.
