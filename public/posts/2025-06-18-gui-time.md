Today's IPM left me feeling very inflated! Going through the Java work and having answers for most of the questions that came up felt really good. My mentor is very good at holding back his questions when helping me and really making me think on the spot with Micah. I don't mind this. It has given me more confidence to stop and think, which is great. Forgetting to add the timers in my ListTest was a silly mistake.

Once I heard that I am being tasked with building the GUI for my tic-tac-toe, I definitely began feeling the nerves again. The presentation is also a little worrying as the information was so long ago. My notes are very good though, so I hope I can come up with something.

I will end today spend looking at my notes and coming up with ideas for my presentation. It was a great day and I'm happy to have another week under my belt here as an apprentice!
