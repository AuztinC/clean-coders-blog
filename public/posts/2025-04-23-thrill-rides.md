There is a moment that is so euphoric whenever a problem is solved through a new function or test is passed green. These are the moments that I strive for when coding, always learning a new way to do something. However, whenever the problem at hand is so close to being complete you can just smell it, and yet so far out of reach, this is an opposing feeling that we all dread I'm sure. Today I had that dreadful feeling, finding the highest divisible triangular number with over 500 divisors.

Jumping into the problem and after stopping to think about all of the steps I might need to achieve this goal, I decided to start with counting how many divisors a number has. This was a simple process I thought and started out with a function that checks mod against a range all the way up to the number. Looking back I can easily see why this became an issue! Checking every number into the Millions becomes a costly afair, and this takes time.

This problem was a simple concept that needed to be refactored after expanding my test numbers beyond the 100 divisors range.Eventually, after hours of thinking what I am missing and looking through how to increase the speed of a function using a range like this, I saw a hint about prime-factorization. This is a problem that seemed very simple, because I had done a prime-factor euler before, so, this should be a breeze. right? Well. Wanting to get a deeper understanding of what exactly prime-factorization even means, I went to Khan academy to gain some math skills.

This was an interesting situation where I found myself with something that was working, just not to the extent that I needed. Realistically, I could have let my function run. Who knows how long it would have taken to reach the target number of 70 million and something. I'm happy to have learned the concept better, though. Learning like this can be painful in the moment, but usually results in a deeper understanding of the topic.

Ready to take on Tic Tac Toe soon! Another great day of learning as an apprentice!
