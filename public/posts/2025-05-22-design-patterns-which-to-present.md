title: "Design Patterns, Which to present!?"

After my meeting yesterday, I was ready to dive into my presentation that I will present during lunch and learn tomorrow. This presentation was a bit more challenging to put together in a timely manner, as I wasn't aware of just how many design patterns there really are! Spending time going through each one in multiple example cases was more time consuming than expected, however it did result in me thinking about multiple ways that I could go back and refactor my tic-tac-toe game.

Eventually deciding on the Template Design Pattern to present and looking for examples within my own work to relate the pattern to better. I found a place that my code was voilating this pattern and a simple refactor made a great example of what the pattern can help prevent.

Learning about edn files and how to read/write was a really exciting adventure! Going into the problem, I decided to create the file and found a simple documentation walking through the basics, then it was off to the races with implementing the ability to "split" at the file and save my game one move at a time. This came together quicker than I had anticipated, which was a relief.

Today felt like a big day of making good progress with totally new ideas, and I loved it! Another awesome day as a Clean Coders apprentice!
