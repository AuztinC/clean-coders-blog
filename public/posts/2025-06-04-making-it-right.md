After working through the bowling kata twice in the morning and poking around at my tic-tac-toe for improvements in tests and refactor opportunities, I went into the IPM ready to show off my new feature and test suite to back it up. Stumbling through my bowling kata was a slight set back and a first time that I had to stop and even think about that step, such a trivial thing to get stuck on. Although, I was happy to receive feedback about some refactoring that could remove the duplication of values under the hood of the program. Looking at how to handle the kata in a different manor using static methods was a great view into how diverse Java can be.

My test suite came up short! Once I was in a roll of showing off my tests it was pointed out that I was doing tests directly to one storage method and not using the method carried by my state. This was a painful blow to see that I had been writing this out with ignorance to my other storage options.

Going into the new week, I will stay positive and keep on testing my way to victory. I have decided on the Adapter design pattern for my presentation so I will be researching and putting that together tomorrow. There is a chance that I might go ahead and mess with postgres now as well to see what I am getting myself into early and see if I will need assistance setting anything up.

Very happy to have an extremely knowledgable and forgiving mentor. Alex has been a god-send of understanding and patience and I leave every meeting feeling empowered. A true mentor.
