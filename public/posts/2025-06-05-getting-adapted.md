You are working on your car. It is a simple problem that only requires you to have a ratchet that is the proper size. You have the size of ratchet that you need, only the drive on your ratchet is too small! You will need an adapter that will allow your ratchet to interface with the socket that you need to fix the part. This is the adapter pattern in a brief overview. Allowing one systemA to accomadate and work with another systemB whos expected language might not be exactly what the systemA is looking to receive.

After comleting my Java kata it was recommended to me to find a solution using static methods. This took me some extra time to learn about and I even met with a fellow apprentice who is more experienced with Java. Ultimately, I'm not sure that I ended up working towards the solution in a way that would be efficient in any manor. Once I had spent a fair amount of time looking into the topic, I started to feel the pressure of the stories for the week and resorted to recording my kata video in the way I had previously complete it.

Tomorrow I will present about the Adapter design pattern and also would like to get the updated functionality of saving previous-games in my db state working properly.
