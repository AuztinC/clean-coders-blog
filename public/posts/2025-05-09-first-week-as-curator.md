My skateboarding theme for the week was a slight success. It was fun to choose people to speak about every morning and share some of my passion for skateboarding with my team. I believe Jason Lee was the winner of the week. Being a famous actor helped create add something for people to relate to, if they have seen the show even once.

Presenting the Interface Segregation principle went well this week. Showing the relationship between the ISP and the LSP was a great choice, I only wish I would have thought to mention the tie in with the SRP as well. Alex was right to point it out as they go hand-in-hand.

Starting off with the Quil example project was a great introduction to the tool. I am really liking the simplicity of the workflow. Having preset setup, update,and draw abilities built in is extremely helpful for getting started quickly. After fiddling for a while, I am able to create a screen of squares and change random squares color by changing a :on value to 0 or 1. This will come in handy when tying in the logic for the Game of Life. I'm excited to work more with the tool and better understand the Kata itself. A visual project will be a nice to the terminal projects I've been doing.
