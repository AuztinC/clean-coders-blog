Another really great meeting with my mentor Alex and Micah during my iterative meeting. I really am thrilled to get such positive feedback on any aspect of my projects. Working through the problem while trying to find the simplest solution really paid off. Unfortunately I did not have a full test suit to back this up, as was pointed out during the meeting. Looking back I must acknowledge my flaws in my work. There is a needless test counting the neighbors of a cell, while none of my future code relies on their being 8 neighbors. The update state function is built fully out with no testing on the different functions that are built within the update itself.

I am grateful for the feeback and ready to make progess on my new features for my tic-tac-toe! The problems are ramping up and becoming problems that I have wanted to solve for a long time. Saving to a file and restarting a game in progress is a really exciting thing to me so I can't wait to implement it!
