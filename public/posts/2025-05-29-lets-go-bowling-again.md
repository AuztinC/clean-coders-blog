Learning about testing in Java today went really well. After spending a small amount of time researching my options I came accross Junit and was able to have IntelliJ download and import everything necessary into my project. Getting my tests up and running was no problem after I got Junit added into my run/debug configurations. This was fantastic progress and allowed me to write my very first test!

Excited and filled with confidence I moved forward with my bowling kata, creating a test that would force me to create a Game class. Java and IntelliJ make this incredibly easy to do if a name is not recognized. Being able to whip up new class files and methods, fields, or anything else you need inside of it so quickly is very fun and makes me feel like I'm doing a lot even when I was only getting a single test going.
