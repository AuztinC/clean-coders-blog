The twelve transformation that are small changes within your code that will alter the behavior in a specific way. The priority of these behaviors matters and should be used with the highest of available priority transformations to be used in a situation. Watching Uncle Bob solve the example problem and ending up with two different sorting algorithms as a result was a shocking thing to see. Just by adding a computation to a new variable rather than assigning to an existing state, the speed of the algorithm improved by miles!

Getting to get a better look at how to properly stub a functions behavior today was great. The ability to check the invokation of a function and spy to see the about of calls. This is very exciting to see the tools used in the language I am actively trying to learn.

Ready to present the Interface Segregation Principle tomorrow!
