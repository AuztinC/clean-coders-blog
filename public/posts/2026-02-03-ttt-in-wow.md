Today was a lot of fun. I have had the urge to play a game that I have stepped away from for a long time, recently. World of Warcraft has been a big part of my gaming lifestyle since probably 2006-2007. Ever since I found out that addons are created by users for the game I have been interested in how they are created. Now that I have a much better idea of how programming works and have used multiple languages I thought why not give it a shot? 

It turns out that it isn't that hard at all. A config file (.toc) can be set up as simply as shown below and the game will read it as an Addon and display it in your client, which is pretty cool!!

After spending some time playing with the actual WoW API I got an idea. Why not be able to play Tic-Tac-Toe IN the game!? The game features a fair amount of downtime while traveling and such, so this would be a great way to pass some time now and again. 

Not knowing Lua was a bit of a setback, but I went ahead and got some help with the game logic in Lua. Having written Tic-Tac-Toe as many times as I had to while in the apprenticeship at Clean Coders set me up to be able to pump out the game in no time, regardless of language. And so, a new addon was born - and here is the finished result!
