Who doesn't love the Roman's? They gave us so many great things like aquaducts, concrete, roads. But amazingly they also invented a number system that is really quite simple yet, elegant. Easy to understand and simple to write out. But how do we equate these to our numbers we use today? A problem I tackled today and learned some things along the way!

This problem was fun to solve because so far in my problems I haven't had to use data from a map. Starting off, I went for a function that would calculate each number using a conditional and really thought I was on the right track for a minute there. Once I decided to test double digit numbers I quickly realized the error in my thinking. How would I calculate for subtractions with this method? It would have ended up much more complicated I believe, so I reset my thinking. What if I made a map and used it as a lookup table for the values of the incoming numerals! So I set off in this new direction which made finding the numbers easy. This was a promising result but I still had to solve the problem of, 'What if I need to subtract?'. Eventually after messing about in the code and trying various things, I wound up checking if the next index in the string's value is greater than the current value. This lead to a promising result, although in what felt like a messy way. I am proud to have solved this one and had fun learning the process.

After completing the kata for the first time I decided to tackle the presentation for tomorrow's lunch and learn. Using my notes and going back into the video about the open-closed principle I came up with what I believe is a solid presentation showcasing the do's and do-not's of the principle itself. I am excited to get some feedback on the more traditional approach of presenting.

A beautiful day of solving problems and growing my brain. I cannot wait to tackle tomorrow and make some bounds on tic-tac-toe!
